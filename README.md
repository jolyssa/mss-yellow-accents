## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I had the exciting opportunity to create the Moji Static Studios website, where I combined my passion for web development with a creative vision. From the ground up, I designed the site to be a reflection of the studio’s innovative spirit and commitment to delivering high-quality web solutions.

The process started with brainstorming sessions to nail down the overall look and feel. I wanted the website to be visually appealing and user-friendly, so I focused on clean layouts, engaging graphics, and smooth navigation. I ensured the site captured the vibrant energy of Moji Static Studios while maintaining a professional edge that resonates with potential clients.

Throughout the development phase, I utilised my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring the design to life. The goal was to create an experience where users could easily explore the services offered and connect with the team.

Incorporating client feedback was also key to the project. I collaborated closely with the Moji Static Studios team to understand their vision and adjust the site based on their insights. This collaborative approach allowed me to fine-tune the content and layout, ensuring it truly represented the brand's identity.

Additionally, I emphasised accessibility in the design. I wanted every visitor to feel welcome, so I implemented best practices to ensure the site is easy to navigate for everyone, regardless of their abilities.

Overall, creating the Moji Static Studios website was an enriching experience that highlighted my technical skills and creative thinking. It’s rewarding to see the site live and serving as a platform to showcase the studio's exceptional web development services. I'm proud to have played a role in building a digital space that not only attracts clients but also reflects the unique personality of Moji Static Studios.

## Lessons Learned:
Creating the Moji Static Studios website was a fantastic learning experience that taught me valuable lessons in web development and project management.

1. **Importance of Planning:** One of the biggest lessons was the significance of thorough planning before diving into the design and development phases. Taking the time to outline the site's structure, layout, and content helped streamline the entire process, making it easier to stay organised and focused.

2. **Collaboration is Key:** Working closely with the Moji Static Studios team reinforced the value of collaboration. Regular check-ins and open communication ensured that everyone was aligned on the vision, which led to better feedback and adjustments throughout the project. This experience highlighted how collaborative efforts can lead to a stronger final product.

3. **User Experience Matters:** I learned that prioritising user experience (UX) is essential for any website. Designing with the user in mind—considering factors like navigation, accessibility, and responsiveness—helped me create a site that is easy and enjoyable to use. This focus on UX not only enhances user satisfaction but also contributes to achieving the site’s goals.

4. **Technical Skills Development:** This project pushed me to refine my technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained hands-on experience implementing responsive design techniques and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, I learned to troubleshoot issues more effectively, which boosted my confidence as a developer.

5. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Throughout the project, I encountered challenges that required quick thinking and adaptability. Whether it was making last-minute changes based on client feedback or troubleshooting unexpected bugs, I learned the importance of staying flexible and finding solutions under pressure.

6. **Accessibility Awareness:** Focusing on accessibility was another critical lesson. I became more aware of the importance of designing websites that cater to all users, regardless of their abilities. Implementing best practices for accessibility not only improved the site but also deepened my understanding of inclusive design principles.

7. **Testing and Iteration:** Finally, I learned that thorough testing is crucial before launching any website. Iterating based on user testing and feedback helped me catch issues early on and refine the overall experience. This practice emphasised the need for continual improvement, even after the site goes live.

Overall, creating the Moji Static Studios website was a rewarding journey that enhanced my technical abilities and taught me invaluable lessons about collaboration, user-centered design, and the importance of flexibility in the development process. I'm excited to apply these lessons to future projects!
